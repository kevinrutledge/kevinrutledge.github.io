        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          My journey into tech wasn't a straight line. It started on the
          athletic track and ultimately led me to software engineering. Here's
          how I made the leap.

          From Athlete to Coach: Building a Foundation
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Early in my career, I was immersed in the world of sports, first as an
          athlete and then as a track and field coach. Coaching, particularly in
          jumps, instilled in me the importance of discipline, leadership, and
          teamwork — skills that have proven invaluable in the tech world.

          A New Direction: Logistics and the Spark of Optimization
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Seeking a more sustainable career path, I transitioned to a Warehouse
          Logistics Specialist role at Milestone Technologies. This experience
          exposed me to the critical role of precision and efficiency in
          inventory management, sparking my interest in process optimization
          through technology.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">Discovering the Power of Code</h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          To streamline my work in logistics, I began exploring Python scripting
          to automate repetitive tasks. This reduced manual effort and freed me
          to focus on leading my team more effectively. This hands-on experience
          ignited a passion for software development and problem-solving.

          Rising to the Challenge: Quality Assurance and Automation
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          My initiative in automation led to a promotion to Junior Quality
          Assurance Analyst at Milestone Technologies. Here, I gained a deeper
          understanding of the software development lifecycle, collaborating
          with cross-functional teams to ensure product quality. I leveraged
          tools like PyTest and Selenium to automate testing processes,
          significantly enhancing efficiency and product reliability.

          The Pandemic Pivot: Embracing My Passion
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          When the COVID-19 pandemic forced our office to close, I found myself
          at a crossroads. This period of uncertainty clarified my true calling:
          coding and technology. Determined to pursue this path, I enrolled at
          De Anza College to formally study Computer Science. Overcoming the
          challenges of rigorous coursework solidified my commitment and
          resilience.

          Reaching New Heights: Academic Excellence and Beyond
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          My dedication paid off. I excelled at De Anza, earning a place on the
          dean's list and acceptance into California Polytechnic State
          University, San Luis Obispo's competitive computer science program.
          This achievement cemented my path to becoming a software engineer.
        </p>

        <h2 class="blog-mini-title">The Journey Continues</h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Now, as a Computer Scientist at Cal Poly SLO, I'm eager to contribute
          to innovative projects and collaborate with talented teams. My diverse
          background allows me to approach challenges with a unique perspective.
          I'm excited to see where this journey leads in the ever-evolving world
          of technology.
