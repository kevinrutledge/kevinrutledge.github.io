          From Athlete to Coach: Building a Foundation
        </h2>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Early in my career, I was immersed in the world of sports, first as an
          athlete and then as a track and field coach. Coaching, particularly in
          jumps, instilled in me the importance of discipline, leadership, and
          teamwork — skills that have proven invaluable in the tech world.

        </h2>

          Seeking a more sustainable career path, I transitioned to a Warehouse
          Logistics Specialist role at Milestone Technologies. This experience
          exposed me to the critical role of precision and efficiency in
          inventory management, sparking my interest in process optimization
          through technology.
